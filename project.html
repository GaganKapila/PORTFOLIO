As a growing, late-stage startup, we look for self-starters who thrive in a fast-paced, agile environment – which means wearing many hats, being able to change direction quickly, and showing an eagerness to learn new technologies as the need arises. And most importantly – we look for people who can prioritize, multitask, and deliver – because it’s a lot more fun to get things done.

Ratehub offers a friendly, innovative and collaborative work environment and our engineering team is based in downtown Kingston, ON. Our talented team drives our success, and we support each individual in fulfilling his or her potential.</p>
